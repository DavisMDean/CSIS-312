Good Davis but you are inconsistent in the PieceWorker class with respect to the wage instance variable. 
It is declared as an int but the "getter" returns a double even though the "setter" takes an int.
Realistically, it should be double since the wage per piece will probably need to take a fractional amount.

Otherwise good work.
